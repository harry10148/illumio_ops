# Security Rules Reference

> **[English](Security_Rules_Reference.md)** | **[繁體中文](Security_Rules_Reference_zh.md)**

This document describes all built-in security detection rules included in Illumio PCE Monitor's traffic report engine. Rules are evaluated automatically whenever a traffic report is generated and their results appear in the **Security Findings** section of every HTML and Excel report.

---

## Overview

Rules are split into two series:

| Series | Rules | Focus |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **B-series** (Baseline) | B001–B009 | Ransomware exposure, policy coverage gaps, behavioural anomalies |
| **L-series** (Lateral Movement) | L001–L010 | Attacker pivoting, credential theft, blast-radius paths, exfiltration |

All thresholds are configurable in **`config/report_config.yaml`** under the `thresholds:` key. No code changes are required to tune sensitivity.

---

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Typical response |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **CRITICAL** | Confirmed or near-certain active attack path | Remediate within 24 hours |
| **HIGH** | Significant exposure enabling lateral movement or exfiltration | Remediate within 1 week |
| **MEDIUM** | Policy gap or elevated risk that should be addressed | Scheduled remediation |
| **LOW** | Informational risk, low probability of exploitation | Track and monitor |
| **INFO** | Environmental observation, no immediate action required | Review periodically |

---

## B-Series — Baseline Rules

### B001 · Ransomware Risk Port `CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / INFO`

**Category:** Ransomware

**What it checks:**
Scans for any non-blocked flow on the four most critical ransomware lateral-spread ports and applies **contextual severity** based on network proximity and traffic policy:

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 135 | TCP | Microsoft RPC (remote procedure calls) |
| 445 | TCP | SMB (Windows file sharing / EternalBlue vector) |
| 3389 | TCP/UDP | RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) |
| 5985 / 5986 | TCP | WinRM (Windows Remote Management) |

**Why it matters:**
These are the exact ports used in EternalBlue, NotPetya, WannaCry, and the majority of modern ransomware campaigns for network-wide lateral spread. However, not all RDP/SMB flows are malicious — domain controllers, patch management servers, and jump hosts legitimately use these ports within the same subnet. Context is required to judge true risk.

**Contextual severity tiers:**

| Severity | Condition |
|:---|:---|
| **CRITICAL** | Any flow crosses **environment boundaries** (e.g., Dev→Prod, Test→Prod) |
| **HIGH** | Flow crosses a **/24 subnet boundary** and is explicitly `allowed` (not just test-mode) |
| **MEDIUM** | Flows are **within the same /24 subnet** *or* exist only in test/visibility mode (not enforced) |
| **INFO** | All flows are same-subnet **AND** all are test-mode — likely legitimate admin traffic |

**Trigger condition:**
At least one flow on ports {135, 445, 3389, 5985, 5986} with `policy_decision != 'blocked'`.

**Threshold key:** *(no threshold — triggers on any match; severity is contextual)*

**Recommended action:**
- **CRITICAL**: Immediately create environment-boundary deny rules — cross-env RPC/SMB/RDP is almost never legitimate
- **HIGH**: Investigate cross-subnet flows; confirm source is an authorised jump host or management system
- **MEDIUM**: Review test-mode workloads; consider moving to enforced mode; validate same-subnet admin access is intentional
- **INFO**: Likely benign same-subnet admin traffic — validate and document; consider closing to reduce noise

---

### B002 · Ransomware Risk Port (High) `HIGH`

**Category:** Ransomware

**What it checks:**
Detects allowed flows on secondary remote-access and persistence ports:

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 5938 | TCP/UDP | TeamViewer |
| 5900 | TCP/UDP | VNC (Virtual Network Computing) |
| 137 / 138 / 139 | UDP/TCP | NetBIOS Name Service / Datagram |

**Why it matters:**
Ransomware operators and APT groups use TeamViewer, VNC, and NetBIOS extensively for persistent remote control and C2 communication after initial compromise.

**Trigger condition:**
At least one flow with `policy_decision = 'allowed'` on these ports.

**Threshold key:** *(no threshold — triggers on any match)*

**Recommended action:**
- Remove or tightly scope any allow rules for remote-access tools to known source IPs/ranges only
- Block NetBIOS globally unless required for legacy Windows environments
- Replace TeamViewer/VNC with a PAM (Privileged Access Management) solution

---

### B003 · Ransomware Risk Port (Medium) — Test Mode `MEDIUM`

**Category:** Ransomware

**What it checks:**
Detects medium-risk ports with `policy_decision = 'potentially_blocked'` — meaning the segmentation rule exists but the workload is still in **visibility/test mode** and the block is **not yet enforced**.

Monitored ports include: SSH (22), NFS (2049), FTP (20/21), mDNS (5353), LLMNR (5355), HTTP (80), WSD (3702), SSDP (1900), Telnet (23).

**Why it matters:**
`potentially_blocked` is a deceptive state: the rule appears in the PCE, but traffic flows through unrestricted. This is the most common cause of "we had policies but still got breached" — the policies were real but the workloads were never moved to enforcement.

**Trigger condition:**
At least one flow with `policy_decision = 'potentially_blocked'` on medium-risk ports.

**Threshold key:** *(no threshold — triggers on any match)*

**Recommended action:**
- Move workloads from visibility/test mode to selective or full enforcement
- Prioritise workloads that handle medium-risk ports (SSH, FTP, HTTP)

---

### B004 · Unmanaged Source High Activity `MEDIUM`

**Category:** UnmanagedHost

**What it checks:**
Counts the total number of flows originating from hosts with `src_managed = False` (not enrolled in the PCE).

**Why it matters:**
Unmanaged hosts have no VEN agent and therefore no micro-segmentation enforcement. They sit outside the zero-trust boundary and represent an uncontrolled attack surface — whether they are shadow IT, contractor machines, or attacker-controlled hosts.

**Trigger condition:**
Total unmanaged-source flows exceed `unmanaged_connection_threshold` (default: **50**).

**Threshold key:** `unmanaged_connection_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Investigate and identify each unmanaged source IP
- Onboard legitimate hosts to the PCE or apply explicit deny rules
- Block unmanaged sources from accessing any sensitive port

---

### B005 · Low Policy Coverage `MEDIUM`

**Category:** Policy

**What it checks:**
Calculates `allowed_flows / total_flows × 100` as the policy coverage percentage. Triggers if this falls below the threshold.

**Why it matters:**
Low coverage means the majority of observed traffic is either uncontrolled (no explicit rule) or blocked by default. In either case, the segmentation policy is incomplete and large sections of the network have no micro-segmentation protection.

**Trigger condition:**
`coverage_pct < min_policy_coverage_pct` (default: **30%**).

**Threshold key:** `min_policy_coverage_pct`

**Recommended action:**
- Use the **Uncovered Flows** report section to identify the highest-volume uncovered paths
- Prioritise rule creation for production application tiers first
- Use Illumio's Rule Writing Wizard to generate rules from observed traffic

---

### B006 · High Lateral Movement (Fan-Out) `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Groups flows on lateral movement ports (RDP 3389, VNC 5900, SSH 22, SMB 445, WinRM 5985/5986, TeamViewer 5938, Telnet 23) by source IP, and counts how many distinct destination IPs each source contacted.

**Why it matters:**
A single source contacting many destinations on lateral movement ports is the textbook indicator of worm propagation, network scanning, or an attacker systematically pivoting through the environment. This is the pattern exhibited by tools like Mimikatz + PsExec, BloodHound-guided movement, and ransomware self-propagation.

**Trigger condition:**
At least one source IP contacts more than `lateral_movement_outbound_dst` distinct destinations (default: **10**) on lateral ports.

**Threshold key:** `lateral_movement_outbound_dst`

**Recommended action:**
- Immediately isolate the offending source IPs for investigation
- Apply emergency quarantine labels via the PCE Quarantine feature
- Review all allowed rules that permit these source IPs to communicate on lateral ports

---

### B007 · Single User High Destinations `HIGH`

**Category:** UserActivity

**What it checks:**
For flows that include a `user_name` field, counts how many distinct destination IPs each user reached. Triggers if any user exceeds the threshold.

**Why it matters:**
A single user account reaching an unusually high number of unique destinations is a red flag for: compromised credentials used in automated scanning, a user performing unsanctioned data staging, or a service account that has been hijacked.

**Trigger condition:**
Any single user contacts more than `user_destination_threshold` distinct destination IPs (default: **20**).

**Threshold key:** `user_destination_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Review the flagged user accounts in the PCE event log
- Check whether the accounts have been used from unusual locations or at unusual times
- Reset credentials and apply MFA if compromise is suspected

---

### B008 · High Bandwidth Anomaly `MEDIUM`

**Category:** Bandwidth

**What it checks:**
Computes the `high_bytes_percentile`-th percentile of byte volume across all flows. Flags any flow that exceeds this threshold.

**Why it matters:**
Sudden high-volume transfers from unexpected sources are a key indicator of data staging (attacker collecting data before exfiltration), large unauthorised backups, or misconfigured applications generating excessive traffic.

**Trigger condition:**
Any flow's `bytes_total` exceeds the `high_bytes_percentile`-th percentile of the dataset (default: **95th percentile**).

**Threshold key:** `high_bytes_percentile`

**Recommended action:**
- Investigate the flagged source-destination pairs — are they legitimate?
- Check if the transfer aligns with scheduled backup windows
- Apply egress bandwidth controls or explicit deny rules for unexpected large-volume sources

---

### B009 · Cross-Environment Flow Volume `INFO`

**Category:** Policy

**What it checks:**
Counts flows where `src_env != dst_env` (e.g., Production → Development, Staging → Production), excluding flows with empty environment labels.

**Why it matters:**
Environment boundaries are your macro-segmentation layer. Excessive cross-environment traffic may indicate lateral movement from a compromised lower-security zone into production, or misconfigured applications bypassing environment isolation.

**Trigger condition:**
Cross-environment flow count exceeds `cross_env_connection_threshold` (default: **100**).

**Threshold key:** `cross_env_connection_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Review which application pairs are generating cross-env traffic
- Validate that all cross-env flows are intentional and documented
- Apply environment-boundary deny rules for any unexpected cross-env patterns

---

## L-Series — Lateral Movement Rules

These rules focus specifically on the **attacker kill-chain after initial compromise**: how an attacker moves laterally, escalates privileges, exfiltrates data, and evades detection. Methodology is based on analysis of real-world attack patterns and the Illumio MCP server security analysis framework.

---

### L001 · Cleartext Protocol in Use `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Detects any traffic on cleartext / legacy protocols:

| Port | Service | Risk |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 23 | Telnet | Credentials sent in plaintext |
| 20 / 21 | FTP | Credentials and data sent in plaintext |

**Why it matters:**
Any attacker with network access can perform ARP poisoning or a MITM attack and capture credentials directly from Telnet/FTP sessions without breaking any encryption. These captured credentials are then immediately usable for lateral movement to any system where the same password is reused.

**Trigger condition:**
At least one flow on ports {23, 20, 21} exists. Severity escalates to HIGH if any such flows are explicitly `allowed`.

**Threshold key:** *(no threshold — triggers on any match)*

**Recommended action:**
- Decommission all Telnet and FTP services immediately
- Replace with SSH (port 22) and SFTP
- Apply deny rules in Illumio for ports 20, 21, and 23 across all environments

---

### L002 · Network Discovery Protocol Exposure `MEDIUM`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Detects unblocked flows on broadcast/discovery protocols:

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 137 / 138 | UDP | NetBIOS Name Service / Datagram |
| 5353 | UDP | mDNS (Multicast DNS) |
| 5355 | UDP | LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) |
| 1900 | UDP | SSDP (UPnP) |
| 3702 | UDP | WSD (Web Services Discovery) |

**Why it matters:**
Tools like **Responder** and **Inveigh** exploit LLMNR and NetBIOS poisoning to intercept name resolution requests and respond with attacker-controlled IPs. The victim's machine then sends NTLM authentication to the attacker, who captures the NTLMv2 hash — all without any user interaction. These hashes can be cracked offline or relayed directly to other systems.

**Trigger condition:**
More than `discovery_protocol_threshold` unblocked flows on these ports (default: **10**).

**Threshold key:** `discovery_protocol_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Block NetBIOS (137/138), LLMNR (5355), and SSDP (1900) at the Illumio policy level
- These protocols serve no legitimate purpose in modern micro-segmented environments
- Enable SMB signing on all Windows workloads to prevent hash relay attacks

---

### L003 · Database Port Wide Exposure `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Checks whether database ports are reachable with `policy_decision = 'allowed'` from more than `db_unique_src_app_threshold` distinct source application labels:

| Port | Service |
|:---|:---|
| 1433 | Microsoft SQL Server |
| 3306 | MySQL / MariaDB |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL |
| 1521 | Oracle Database |
| 27017 | MongoDB |
| 6379 | Redis |
| 9200 | Elasticsearch |
| 5984 | CouchDB |
| 50000 | IBM DB2 |

**Why it matters:**
Databases should only be reachable from their direct application tier — typically 1-2 application labels. Wide exposure means an attacker who achieves lateral movement to any of those many source apps can directly query production databases, exfiltrate data via SQL queries, or escalate via stored procedures and xp_cmdshell.

**Trigger condition:**
Database ports reachable from more than `db_unique_src_app_threshold` unique source app labels (default: **5**).

**Threshold key:** `db_unique_src_app_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Create Illumio rule-sets that explicitly list which application labels may reach each database
- All other sources should have a default deny for database ports
- Review the top-listed source apps in evidence — remove any that don't have a business justification

---

### L004 · Cross-Environment Database Access `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Detects `allowed` database flows (same port list as L003) where `src_env != dst_env`.

**Why it matters:**
Environment boundaries are the macro-segmentation layer protecting Production from Development and Staging. A Dev application reaching a Production database directly bypasses all environment-level controls and is a direct path for an attacker who has compromised a lower-security environment to pivot into production data stores.

**Trigger condition:**
At least one allowed database flow crossing environment boundaries.

**Threshold key:** *(no threshold — any cross-env DB flow triggers)*

**Recommended action:**
- No application in Development or Staging should directly access Production databases
- Use read replicas, API gateways, or data pipelines as the cross-environment interface
- Apply Illumio deny rules at environment boundaries for all database ports

---

### L005 · Identity Infrastructure Wide Exposure `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Detects non-blocked flows on identity infrastructure ports from more than `identity_unique_src_threshold` distinct source applications:

| Port | Service |
|:---|:---|
| 88 | Kerberos (authentication) |
| 389 | LDAP |
| 636 | LDAPS (LDAP over TLS) |
| 3268 / 3269 | Active Directory Global Catalog |
| 464 | Kerberos Password Change |

**Why it matters:**
Active Directory is the master authentication authority for the entire Windows domain. Excessive access to these ports enables:
- **BloodHound** — domain enumeration to find attack paths to Domain Admin
- **Kerberoasting** — requesting service tickets for offline password cracking
- **AS-REP Roasting** — attacking accounts without Kerberos pre-auth
- **Golden Ticket / Silver Ticket** — forging Kerberos tickets for persistent domain access

**Trigger condition:**
More than `identity_unique_src_threshold` unique source apps have non-blocked flows on identity ports (default: **3**).

**Threshold key:** `identity_unique_src_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Restrict Kerberos and LDAP to domain-joined workloads only
- Applications should use service accounts that wrap LDAP calls — never expose raw LDAP to application tiers broadly
- Block LDAP from all non-production environments to AD

---

### L006 · High Blast-Radius Lateral Path `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Builds a directed app→app communication graph using only `allowed` flows on lateral movement ports. Runs BFS (Breadth-First Search) from every application node to compute how many other applications each node can reach through a chain of lateral-port connections.

**Why it matters:**
This is a direct implementation of the **detect-lateral-movement-paths** methodology from the Illumio MCP server. An application with high BFS reachability is the highest-value target for an attacker: compromising it grants potential access to every application in its reachable subgraph. These are the nodes where a single breach has the largest blast radius.

**Trigger condition:**
At least one application node can reach ≥ `blast_radius_threshold` other apps via lateral ports (default: **5**).

**Threshold key:** `blast_radius_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Review the top pivot apps listed in evidence and determine whether those lateral-port connections are necessary
- Apply Illumio intra-scope rules to limit which apps can use lateral ports
- Target the highest-reachability apps for isolation first — they represent the largest risk reduction per rule added

---

### L007 · Unmanaged Host Accessing Critical Services `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Detects non-blocked flows from unmanaged hosts (`src_managed = False`) on critical service ports:
- Database ports (L003 list)
- Identity ports (L005 list)
- Windows management ports: RPC (135), SMB (445), WinRM (5985/5986/47001)

**Why it matters:**
Unmanaged hosts have no VEN enforcement — they exist outside the zero-trust boundary. An unmanaged host reaching a database, Active Directory, or Windows management port may be: shadow IT running unsanctioned software, an attacker-controlled host that was never enrolled, or a contractor machine that bypasses your segmentation policy entirely.

**Trigger condition:**
More than `unmanaged_critical_threshold` non-blocked flows from unmanaged sources on critical ports (default: **5**).

**Threshold key:** `unmanaged_critical_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Identify each unmanaged source IP — is it a known asset?
- Onboard legitimate hosts to the PCE immediately
- Apply explicit deny rules for unmanaged-to-critical-service traffic
- For unknown IPs, treat as potentially compromised and investigate

---

### L008 · Lateral Ports in Test Mode (PB) `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Identifies flows with `policy_decision = 'potentially_blocked'` on lateral movement ports, database ports, identity ports, and Windows management ports.

**Why it matters:**
`potentially_blocked` is the single most dangerous state in an Illumio deployment: the segmentation **rule exists in the PCE, but the workload is in visibility/test mode so the block is NOT active**. Traffic flows through unrestricted. This is statistically the most common cause of "we had micro-segmentation but still got breached" — the policies were correctly written but never enforced.

**Trigger condition:**
More than `pb_lateral_threshold` potentially-blocked flows on critical ports (default: **10**).

**Threshold key:** `pb_lateral_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- Move affected workloads from visibility/test mode to **selective** or **full** enforcement
- This is the highest-ROI remediation available: rules already exist, only enforcement mode needs changing
- Review the destination apps listed in evidence — prioritise production workloads

---

### L009 · Data Exfiltration Pattern `HIGH`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Detects managed workloads (`src_managed = True`) with `policy_decision = 'allowed'` transferring significant byte volume to unmanaged (`dst_managed = False`) destination IPs.

**Why it matters:**
This is the **post-lateral-movement exfiltration phase**: the attacker has already pivoted to a high-value workload and is now staging or transferring data to an external Command & Control (C2) server or drop site. The pattern — managed-to-unmanaged, high bytes, allowed — is a strong signal because legitimate outbound traffic to external services should be explicitly allowed and scoped, not just passing through to arbitrary unmanaged IPs.

**Trigger condition:**
Total bytes transferred from managed to unmanaged destinations exceeds `exfil_bytes_threshold_mb` MB (default: **100 MB**).

**Threshold key:** `exfil_bytes_threshold_mb`

**Recommended action:**
- Investigate the top destination IPs in evidence — are they known CDN/API endpoints or unknown IPs?
- Implement outbound allowlist rules scoping internet-bound traffic to known IP ranges
- Apply egress controls: all traffic from production workloads to unmanaged IPs should require explicit justification

---

### L010 · Cross-Environment Lateral Port Access `CRITICAL`

**Category:** LateralMovement

**What it checks:**
Detects `allowed` flows on lateral movement ports and Windows management ports between workloads in **different environments** (`src_env != dst_env`).

Monitored ports: SMB (445), RDP (3389), WinRM (5985/5986/47001), RPC (135), SSH (22), TeamViewer (5938), VNC (5900/5901), Telnet (23).

**Why it matters:**
This is rated **CRITICAL** because it represents a complete macro-segmentation failure. Environment boundaries (Production / Development / Staging / DMZ) are your top-level security domains. If lateral movement ports are allowed to cross these boundaries, an attacker who compromises a low-security Development workload can directly apply the exact same lateral movement techniques — PsExec, WMI, RDP — to reach Production systems. The entire purpose of environment segmentation is defeated.

**Trigger condition:**
More than `cross_env_lateral_threshold` allowed flows using lateral/management ports across environment boundaries (default: **5**).

**Threshold key:** `cross_env_lateral_threshold`

**Recommended action:**
- **Immediately** create Illumio deny rules blocking lateral ports at environment boundaries
- This is a P1 remediation — do not wait for a maintenance window
- Review each environment pair in the evidence and determine whether any cross-env management access is intentional (e.g., jump host infrastructure)
- If intentional, scope the allow rule to the specific authorised source IP only

---

## Threshold Configuration Reference

All thresholds are in `config/report_config.yaml` under the `thresholds:` key.

```yaml
thresholds:
  # ── B-series ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  min_policy_coverage_pct: 30         # B005: trigger if coverage % below this
  lateral_movement_outbound_dst: 10   # B006: trigger if src contacts > N unique dst
  user_destination_threshold: 20      # B007: trigger if user reaches > N unique dst
  unmanaged_connection_threshold: 50  # B004: trigger if unmanaged src flows > N
  high_bytes_percentile: 95           # B008: anomaly if bytes > Nth percentile
  cross_env_connection_threshold: 100 # B009: trigger if cross-env flows > N

  # ── L-series ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  discovery_protocol_threshold: 10    # L002: min unblocked discovery flows to trigger
  db_unique_src_app_threshold: 5      # L003: alert if db reachable from > N source apps
  identity_unique_src_threshold: 3    # L005: alert if LDAP/Kerberos from > N source apps
  blast_radius_threshold: 5           # L006: alert if app reaches > N apps via lateral ports
  unmanaged_critical_threshold: 5     # L007: min unmanaged-to-critical-port flows
  pb_lateral_threshold: 10            # L008: min PB flows on lateral ports to alert
  exfil_bytes_threshold_mb: 100       # L009: trigger if managed→unmanaged bytes > N MB
  cross_env_lateral_threshold: 5      # L010: min cross-env lateral flows to alert
```

### Tuning guidance

- **High false-positive environment** (e.g., flat Dev network with many cross-app flows): Increase L003 `db_unique_src_app_threshold` to 10–15 and L005 `identity_unique_src_threshold` to 8–10.
- **Mature segmentation environment** (most workloads enforced): Lower B005 `min_policy_coverage_pct` to 80 to alert only when mature environments regress.
- **Large data-transfer workloads** (backup servers, ETL): Increase `high_bytes_percentile` to 99 or increase `exfil_bytes_threshold_mb` to 500–1000.
- **Strict zero-tolerance environment**: Set `cross_env_lateral_threshold` to 1 so any cross-env lateral port flow triggers immediately.

---

## How to Add Custom Rules (Semantic Rules)

In addition to the built-in B and L rules, you can define custom rules in `config/semantic_config.yaml`. This allows you to write environment-specific detections without modifying code.

```yaml
semantic_rules:
  - id: "S001"
    name: "PCI Zone Lateral Access"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    category: "Policy"
    description: "Any lateral port flow entering the PCI environment"
    condition:
      dst_env: "PCI"
      port: [445, 3389, 135, 5985]
      policy_decision: ["allowed", "potentially_blocked"]
    recommendation: "Block all lateral ports at PCI environment boundary immediately."
```

> **Note:** Full semantic rule evaluation is planned for a future release. Currently, semantic rules are loaded and counted but evaluation logic is not yet active.
